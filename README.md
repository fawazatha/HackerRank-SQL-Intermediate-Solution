# HackerRank-SQL-Intermediate-Solution
This repository contains my solutions for the HackerRank intermediate-level problems using MySQL. These solutions were completed during a test on August 21, 2023. The test consisted of two questions that I had 35 minutes to solve.
Feel free to explore the solutions and the approach I took to solve these challenges. If you find them helpful, consider giving a ‚≠ê to this repository!
